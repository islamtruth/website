title: New Site!

Hey all,

I just got this new site going. I hope it will receive the warm welcome
it deserves. It's not actually that easy to do all of this stuff, you
know -- researching everything, documenting the sources, finding
images and videos to link to, making everything look pretty. But I think
I'm doing a good job. I mean someone has to, the amount of factually
false information on the web is staggering!

I'm still thinking of some things. I feel like the site needs some
interactivity. Maybe a chat? Nah, that would just totally escalate.
Same thing with comments. But maybe a mailing list or something
like that?

If you have any ideas, don't hesitate to contact me! I'd also appreciate
any and all kinds of help with hosting, translating, writing new content,
or even just if you have any corrections, do send them to me. 

Love, Mustafa.
