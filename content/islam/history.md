Where did Islam come from? That is, indeed, a good question. And a difficult
one to answer. **There are [barely any sources][opendemocracy-mohammed] from
the early time of Islam**, but we do know a lot more about what happened after
that.

## Early History

The history, as presented by muslims, is that **Islam originated in the early
7th century by a man known as Muhammad**. He claims to have experienced an
angelic visitation, which had instructed him to become the last prophet
(of Islam). His utterances after that have been recorded in a book known
as the *Qur'an*.

Due to the lack of evidence around the early history of Islam, we don't know
much about what really happened then. We can be fairly certain that **a man
named Mohammed [did live][ismail-muhammad]**, but we don't know what he was up to.
After his death, Islam was in it's infancy and [still developing][rnw-muhammad].

[Islam: The Untold Story][untold-story] is an interesting documentary that
explores the roots of Islam from a historical (rather than a theological)
perspective.

## Golden Age

When we think about the Arabs, we inevitably think about the golden age, the
height of the intellectual achievment of the now Islamic world. But how did
they get there? In two words, violence and tolerance.

## Inventions

While today's age is dominated by inventions from the west, it hasn't
always been like this. There was a time when we were savages, only after
the [Age of Enlightenment][age-of-enlightenment] was it that Europe really
took off as an intellectual powerhouse.

While there are undoubtedly some inventions made by the Islamic world,
many of them are, *sans evidence*, **falsely attributed to Muslims**.

The **hookah** is [a device][hookah] used to smoke **shisha**, a form of tobacco.

Hospitals in the islamic world accepted people with mental illnesses, giving rise
to the first **mental institute** in the world.

**Mercuric chloride** was invented to disinfect wounds. Not used anymore due to
high toxicity.

The Ottoman empire military had the first recorded **marching band**.

The use of **frequency analysis**, a simple method of counting recurrences of
characters to read the primitive [Caesar
ciphers](https://cryptii.com/caesar-cipher), was first documented by an Arab.

**Coffee** was, according to the legend, invented in an Abyssinian
monastery, but the first recorded use was in Yemen.

Despite claims that the first **fountain pen** was developed for an Egyptian
emperor, the first recorded use was much later.

**Arab numerals** and the concept of **zero** were invented 
by the Hindus.

**Algorithms** were invented and used [long before][algorithm-history] the establishment
of Islam.

**Flight** (more like gliding) was invented by the Chinese, with 
the [first recorded flight][uh-flight] in the 6th century.

The earliest known **lenses** predate Islam by [at least one millenium][wikipedia-history-optics],
and the earliest research on **optics** was in ancient India, [followed by
ancient Greek and Romans][benvr-optics].

Making **gunpowder** and using it for rockets was [invented by the Chinese][quatr-gunpowder].

**Gardens** have a history going back much before Islam was ever
mentioned.

While the advances in science from the Islamic world may seem
modest compared to those from the ancient Romans, Greek or
Hindus, these are still significant. **It is the cumulative efforts
of all those that came before us that brought us to where we
are now**. We must not forget that.
