So what is this *islam* thing all about? Since people don't really
know much about islam outside of the Arabic and Asian countries
where it is prevalent, this site serves to educate on the basics
of Islam from a neutral standpoint.

If you want to know [what islam is](#definition), [why we should
care](#relevance) and [how moral it is](#morality), read on. If you want to
know how islam got to where it is now, you may be interested in the
[history](/islam/history) section. If you want to know about what *muslims*
actually believe, check out the [belief](/islam/belief) section. If you want to
know more about islam and muslims today, check out the [current
state](/islam/state) section.

Islam is a monotheistic religion that originated in 7<sup>th</sup> century
middle east[^1]. It is related to [judaism][jewishencyclopedia] and
[christianity][ancient-christianity]. It was preached first to the followers of
it's founder Mohammed, then to all of Arabia; and soon after his death it was
spread to distant lands by the might of the
sword.[^2]

### Relevance

Why do we care about Islam at all? As the second largest religion in the world[^1],
with over 1.7 billion followers[^4], it posesses a lot of hidden manpower. Hidden,
because the Islamic world is composed of countries as obscure and unknown as
Mauritiania, Comoros, Dijbhouti, Sahrawi Republic or Oman. In short, countries
that we want to avoid when travelling:

> Many observers note that Muslim countries score lower than average on
> political development, notably the status of women. And except for oil
> wealth, most Muslim countries are doing poorly on economic and social
> development as well[^7]

Islam has been described (by an ex-muslim) as a moral framework not compatible
with the modern westernised way of living[^5].

> The hard truth is there is a lot of violence endorsed in the Quran, and there
> are other terrible things, as there are in the Old Testament. But there are
> more people in the world — even if it’s a minority of Muslims — who take
> their scripture seriously. It’s dishonest to say that violent Muslim groups
> like ISIS are being un-Islamic.[^6]

So, the relevance of Islam is in the fact that it is being followed by a large
part of the world's population. This population may seen unimportant to us
in the developed world, but we can't ignore it.

### Morality

Unlike many people believe, Islam is neither inherently immoral, nor does it
present a superior morality. Instead, most of Islamic beliefs and teachings can
be arranged on a spectrum ranging from positive to negative.  Such a spectrum
offers a simple introduction to the religion for those who are not familiar
with it yet.

The practise of **zakat**, one of the pillars of Islam,  encourages
muslims to be charitable.

The other pillars, **shahadah**, **salat**, **sawm** and **hajj** are
harmless.

Cleanlyness is encouraged by the **wudhu** ritual.

A common greeting in the muslim world is **salam**, which means peace.

Polygamy is allowed in Islam.

Islamic laws, known as **sharia**, impose such unusual and cruel
punishments as **execution**, **flogging**, **stoning**, 
**forced amputation** (of hands)

Under islamic rule, women are expected to cover their natural body
with any of **hijab**, **niqab**, **burka**, **al-amira**, **shayla**,
**khimar** or **chador**.

Although not directly mentioned in the Qur'an, it is established that
women do not have the right to choose to use **birth-control** or
getting an **abortion**.

The Qur'an condones violence against one's own wife.

Islam stipulates that non-muslims living under muslim rule must pay
**jizyah**, a special tax.

In Islam, a woman's testimony is only worth half of that of a man's.

A lot of controversy exists around **Aisha**, a wife of the Islamic
prophet Muhammed: she was probably around 6 years when they married
and around 10 when they consummated their marriage.

Islam permits **slavery**, and even allows muslims to have sex with their
[female] slaves.

Under the name of **jihad**, Islam sanctions violence when their
territory or faith is under attack.

Leaving the muslim faith is, in many interpretations of the **sharia**,
considered to be punishable by death.

Islam opposes homosexuality, for which the **sharia** often allows
the death penalty.
