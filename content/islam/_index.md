So what is this *Islam* thing all about? Since people don't really
know much about Islam outside of the Arabic and Asian countries
where it is prevalent, this site serves to educate on the basics
of Islam from a neutral standpoint.

This section discusses everything from the [history](/islam/history),
the [belief](/islam/belief) to the [current state](/islam/state)
of Islam and the islamic world. Unlike many people believe, Islam
is neither inherently immoral, nor does it present a superior
morality. Instead, most of Islamic beliefs and teachings can
be arranged on a spectrum ranging from positive to negative.
Such a spectrum offers a simple introduction to the religion for
those who are not familiar with it yet.

The practise of **zakat**, one of the pillars of Islam,  encourages
muslims to be charitable.

The other pillars, **shahadah**, **salat**, **sawm** and **hajj** are
harmless.

Cleanlyness is encouraged by the **wudhu** ritual.

A common greeting in the muslim world is **salam**, which means peace.

Polygamy is allowed in Islam.

Islamic laws, known as **sharia**, impose such unusual and cruel
punishments as **execution**, **flogging**, **stoning**, 
**forced amputation** (of hands)

Under islamic rule, women are expected to cover their natural body
with any of **hijab**, **niqab**, **burka**, **al-amira**, **shayla**,
**khimar** or **chador**.

Although not directly mentioned in the Qur'an, it is established that
women do not have the right to choose to use **birth-control** or
getting an **abortion**.

The Qur'an condones violence against one's own wife.

Islam stipulates that non-muslims living under muslim rule must pay
**jizyah**, a special tax.

In Islam, a woman's testimony is only worth half of that of a man's.

A lot of controversy exists around **Aisha**, a wife of the Islamic
prophet Muhammed: she was probably around 6 years when they married
and around 10 when they consummated their marriage.

Islam permits **slavery**, and even allows muslims to have sex with their
[female] slaves.

Under the name of **jihad**, Islam sanctions violence when their
territory or faith is under attack.

Leaving the muslim faith is, in many interpretations of the **sharia**,
considered to be punishable by death.

Islam opposes homosexuality, for which the **sharia** often allows
the death penalty.
