Unfortunately, in developed, wester nations, people don't really
know much about Islam. This is a problem, because it means that
most people will have a knowledge of Islam that stems from either
Islamic preachers, which do not present a complete and accurate
picture, or from the news, which doesn't represent Islam as a
whole.

However, there have been a few people who have set out to
document Islamic facts, whether they relate to the early history
or to the current state of the religion and it's followers.

Here I present a collection of movies that I have watched myself
and found of highly educational value. Please do keep in mind
that you must be critical of anything you watch or read on the
Internet, regardless of what your position on things is.

## Islam: The Untold Story (2012)

{{< prominent >}}
{{< vimeo 79051482 >}}
{{< /prominent >}}

Muslims have their own story about how and when Islam came to
be. But there is not a single piece of historical evidence to
back up this story -- in fact, some evidence suggests that the
early history of Islam was entirely different from what many
people believe.

This documentary explores the history of Islam from a fact-based
rather than a faith-based perspective. What do we actually know?
What can we tell with certainty?

## This is What Winning Looks Like (2013)

While the previous documentary was all about the early history of
Islam, this is the very opposite to that. VICE presents the current
state of things in Afghanistan, a country plagued by a religious-
extremist group (the Taliban), which has been exascerbated by
American involvement.

While there are a lot of documentaries about Islamic countries
and their current warfare out there, this is probably the most
shocking.

## [My Brother the Islamist][my-brother-the-islamist-imdb] (2011)

If after watching the VICE documentary, you believe that this is
not related to anything at all in the west, then this movie will
blow your mind. 

It tells the sad story of Richard Dart, who falls prey into the
narrative of extremist islamic organisations in the UK. His 
stepbrother, Robb Leech, follows him around, interviewing him
and the people around him on their newfound belief.
