There is a lot of misinformation about Islam on the internet.  In fact, there
is so much that is becomes hard to find real, solid facts. People always have
an agenda, whether it is to convert you to their fantasy or to spread hate and
fear.

As young people across the world are exposed to ideologies and instrumentalized
to fulfill other people's goals, it becomes increasingly difficult to get
access to information.

This website exists to contribute a more balanced viewpoint on Islam. As such,
it is not shy to criticise it. And no matter the viewpoint that is expressed,
people on either side of the argument will be offended.

It is important to offend people, because if we only spread messages that
people like, then we will never find any kind of truth. Some things are just
painful to accept.

The most important thing is to not daemonize muslims. It is necessary to
criticise and point out flaws in ideologies, beliefs, and individuals, but
it is never acceptable to criticise a people as a whole. This website
denounces anyone who does not follow that maxim.

All of the criticisms that this website contains should be understood as
gentle nudges to improve. And there are already some organizations trying
to improve Islam, such as:

* https://ing.org/
* https://clarionproject.org/progressive-muslim-organizations/
* http://navigateislam.com/
